# Music controller
A music controller app with rooms, written in Django and React (work in progress) 

This is an app which allows the users to create rooms and give the access code to other people and control the music together. 

Built following a [great tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j) by [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg).
